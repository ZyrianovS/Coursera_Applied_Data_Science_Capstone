    "In order to answer the above mentioned question the following approach and data will be used:\n",
    "- We will use the results of parsing the Wikipedia page of Toronto's postal codes from week 3 assignment.\n",
    "- Because we narrow down analysis to just one borough (Downtown Toronto), we will not combine neighborhoods with the same postal code as we did in week 3 assignment. That way we will have more distinct neighborhoods for our clustering algorithm to work with.\n",
    "- Then as in week 3 assignment we will get coordinates for all neighborhoods in Downtown Toronto with `geocoder` library.\n",
    "- Then for each coordinate we will make an **explore** Foursquare request with one of the parameters `query='restaurant'` to search for all restaurants in the particular area. We will explore different values for `radius` and `limit` parameters so that we can get more results for our clustering algorithm to work with.\n",
    "- Finally we will execute our clustering algorithm as we did in week 3 assignment and explore the results and hopefully get some valuable insights into the question we are trying to answer."
